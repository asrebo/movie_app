# Implementation Notes

## Requirements not implemented
- No major features left out; core functionality implemented.

  - Full accessibility audit and fixes (ARIA labels, keyboard flows).

## Issues faced during implementation
- Time constraints from other deadline-driven projects limited polishing

## What I would improve with more time

- Harden error handling and input validation.
- Optimize performance (lazy loading, memoization, API call caching).
- Add some interactive feature like page transitions (behind experimental flag in Next.js)
